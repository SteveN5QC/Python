 Exercise 2:  2D Array Access 

Description: 
Learn to work with multi-dimensional arrays (lists of lists) by creating a 3x3 matrix and accessing its elements using nested loops. This exercise will enhance your understanding of how to iterate over complex data structures. 
 
Task: 
Create a 3x3 matrix and print each element using nested loops.
